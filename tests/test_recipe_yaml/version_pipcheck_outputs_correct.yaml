  summary: Code for Anisotropies in the Microwave Background
  description: |
    Code for Anisotropies in the Microwave Background
    by Antony Lewis and Anthony Challinor

    Features:
    - Support for closed, open and flat models
    - Scalar, vector and tensor modes including polarization
    - Output Cl, matter transfer functions, matter power spectrum and Ïƒ8
    - Fast computation to ~0.3-0.1% accuracy, with controllable accuracy level
    - Relatively structured and easily extendable Fortran 90 code
    - Efficient support for massive neutrinos
    - Absolute computations from correctly normalized initial power spectra
    - Computation of lensed CMB power spectra and lensing potential power spectrum
    - Internally parallelized for fast execution on multi-processor machines
    - Use CAMB with CosmoMC for Monte-Carlo parameter estimation
    - Constant equation of state quintessence (or variable PPF)
    - Support for general correlated adiabatic/isocurvature initial conditions
    - Accurate full-sky calculation of lensed power spectra (astro-ph/0502425)
    - Integrated interface to HALOFIT for non-linear fitting
    - support for arbitrary neutrino mass splittings
    - For 21cm, lensing and number count power spectra see this extension
    - For perturbed recombination and effect on small-scale baryons see this extension
    - Calculation of local primordial and CMB lensing bispectra
    - Easy-to-use Python wrapper
